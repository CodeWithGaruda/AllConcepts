in eclipse maven comes default
so u can use it directly with now mvn installed in your system

maven folder structure:
by default maven gives u some folders
ResourceBundle eb=ResourceBunble.getBundle("file");

how to execute maven project
while executing maven project we need to follow certain set of rules

mvn build life cycle:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
validate all files
compile
testing
package
integration testing
verify
install
deploy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to run the maven project
right click on pom.xml
run as > <required option> 
i.e if u wanna test use maven test
but before u use that phase all the previous life cycles will be done

run as > maven build
then it will ask for goal
give clean => this will clean the project
give compile => this will compile the project
here u might get some error u need to configure JDK rather than JRE
window>preferences>java>installed jre's>"here add >standard vm>in jre home give jdk path"

give install =>it will do all previous phases and create a jar in target folder
give test => it will run all the test cases
u can also give two commands at the same time
give clean test
